Also known as a Point Map, Dot Distribution Map.

Dot Maps are a way of detecting spatial patterns or the distribution of data over a geographical region, by placing equally sized points over a geographical region.

Dot Maps are ideal for seeing how things are distributed over a geographical region and can reveal patterns when the points cluster on the map. Dot Maps are easy to grasp and are better at giving an overview of the data, but are not great for retrieving exact values.
